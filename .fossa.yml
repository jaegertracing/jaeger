# FOSSA Configuration File
# https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli/blob/master/docs/references/files/fossa-yml.md
#
# This configuration excludes development-only tooling from license scanning.
# The excluded paths contain GPL-3.0 licensed tools (golangci-lint and its plugins)
# that are used only during development and are NOT compiled into or distributed
# with the final Jaeger binaries.
#
# These tools are in separate Go modules specifically to isolate them from
# production dependencies. Using GPL-licensed development tools to build
# Apache 2.0 licensed software does not create any license compliance issues.
