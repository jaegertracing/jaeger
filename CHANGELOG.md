1.59.0 (2024-07-10)
-------------------

### Backend Changes

#### ⛔ Breaking Changes

* The OTEL Collector upgrade brought in a change where OTLP receivers started listening on `localhost` instead of `0.0.0.0` as before. As a result, when running in container environment the endpoints are likely unreachable from other containers (Issue [#5737](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/5737)). The fix will be available in the next release. Meanwhile, the workaround is to instruct Jaeger to listen on `0.0.0.0`, as in [this fix](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/5734/files#diff-299f817cc4ab077ddb763f1e6a023d9d042d714e2fd3736cc40af3f218d44f1eR15):
```
      - COLLECTOR_OTLP_GRPC_HOST_PORT=0.0.0.0:4317
      - COLLECTOR_OTLP_HTTP_HOST_PORT=0.0.0.0:4318
```

1.47.0 (2023-07-05)
-------------------
### Backend Changes

#### ⛔ Breaking Changes

* [SPM] Due to a breaking change in OpenTelemetry's prometheus exporter ([details](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases/tag/v0.80.0))
  metric names will no longer be normalized by default, meaning that the expected metric names would be `calls` and
  `duration_*`. Backwards compatibility with older OpenTelemetry Collector versions can be achieved through the following flags:
  * `prometheus.query.normalize-calls`: If true, normalizes the "calls" metric name. e.g. "calls_total".
  * `prometheus.query.normalize-duration`: If true, normalizes the "duration" metric name to include the duration units. e.g. "duration_milliseconds_bucket".

#### New Features
* [Cassandra] Add Configuration.Close() to ensure TLS cert watcher is closed ([@kennyaz](https://github.com/kennyaz) in [#4515](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4515))
* Add *.kerberos.disable-fast-negotiation option to Kafka consumer ([@pmuls99](https://github.com/pmuls99) in [#4520](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4520))

1.46.0 (2023-06-05)
-------------------
### Backend Changes

#### ⛔ Breaking Changes

OTLP receiver is now enabled by default ([#4494](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4494)). This change follows the Jaeger's strategic direction of aligning closely with the OpenTelemetry project. This may cause port conflicts if  `jaeger-collector` is depoyed in host network namespace. The original `--collector.otlp.enabled` option is still available and MUST be set to `false` if OTLP receiver is not desired.

### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.12.0. The changelog is available here [v1.12.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v1120-november-14-2020)


1.20.0 (2020-09-29)
-------------------

### Backend Changes

#### ⛔ Breaking Changes
* Configurable ES doc count ([#2453](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/2453), [@albertteoh](https://github.com/albertteoh))

    The `--es.max-num-spans` flag has been deprecated in favour of `--es.max-doc-count`.
    `--es.max-num-spans` is marked for removal in v1.21.0 as indicated in the flag description.

    If both `--es.max-num-spans` and `--es.max-doc-count` are set, the lesser of the two will be used.

    The use of `--es.max-doc-count` (which defaults to 10,000) will limit the results from all Elasticsearch
    queries by the configured value, limiting counts for Jaeger UI:

    * Services
    * Operations
    * Dependencies (edges in a dependency graph)
    * Span fetch size for a trace

* The default value for the flag `query.max-clock-skew-adjustment` has changed to `0s`, meaning that the clock skew adjustment is now disabled by default. See [#1459](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1459).

#### New Features

* Grpc plugin archive storage support ([#2317](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/2317), [@m8rge](https://github.com/m8rge))
* Separate Ports for GRPC and HTTP requests in Query Server ([#2387](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/2387), [@rjs211](https://github.com/rjs211))

1.19.2 (2020-08-26)
-------------------

Upgrade to a working UI version before React refactoring.

### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.7.0. The changelog is available here [v1.7.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v170-february-21-2020)

1.16.0 (2019-12-17)
------------------

### Backend Changes

#### ⛔ Breaking Changes

##### List of service operations can be classified by span kinds ([#1943](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1943), [#1942](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1942), [#1937](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1937), [@guo0693](https://github.com/guo0693))

* Endpoint changes:
    * Both Http & gRPC servers now take new optional parameter `spanKind` in addition to `service`. When spanKind
     is absent or empty, operations from all kinds of spans will be returned.
    * Instead of returning a list of string, both Http & gRPC servers return a list of operation struct. Please
    update your client code to process the new response. Example response:
        ```
        curl 'http://localhost:6686/api/operations?service=UserService&spanKind=server' | jq
        {
            "data": [{
                "name": "UserService::getExtendedUser",
                "spanKind": "server"
            },
            {
                "name": "UserService::getUserProfile",
                "spanKind": "server"
            }],
            "total": 2,
            "limit": 0,
            "offset": 0,
            "errors": null
        }
        ```
    * The legacy http endpoint stay untouched:
        ```
        /services/{%s}/operations
        ```
* Storage plugin changes:
    * Memory updated to support spanKind on write & read, no migration is required.
    * [Badger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1922) & [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1923)
    to be implemented:
    For now `spanKind` will be set as empty string during read & write, only `name` will be valid operation name.
    * Cassandra updated to support spanKind on write & read ([#1937](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1937), [@guo0693](https://github.com/guo0693)):
        If you don't run the migration script, nothing will break, the system will use the old table
        `operation_names` and set empty `spanKind` in the response.
        Steps to get the updated functionality:
        1.  You will need to run the command below on the host where you can use `cqlsh` to connect to Cassandra:
            ```
            KEYSPACE=jaeger_v1 CQL_CMD='cqlsh host 9042 -u test_user -p test_password --request-timeout=3000'
            bash ./v002tov003.sh
            ```
            The script will create new table `operation_names_v2` and migrate data from the old table.
            `spanKind` column will be empty for those data.
            At the end, it will ask you whether you want to drop the old table or not.
        2. Restart ingester & query services so that they begin to use the new table

##### Trace and Span IDs are always padded to 32 or 16 hex characters with leading zeros ([#1956](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1956), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))

Previously, Jaeger backend always rendered trace and span IDs as  the shortest possible hex string, e.g. an ID
with numeric value 255 would be rendered as a string `ff`. This change makes the IDs to always render as 16 or 32
characters long hex string, e.g. the same id=255 would render as `00000000000000ff`. It mostly affects how UI
displays the IDs, the URLs, and the JSON returned from `jaeger-query` service.

Motivation: Among randomly generated and uniformly distributed trace IDs, only 1/16th of them start with 0
followed by a significant digit, 1/256th start with two 0s, and so on in decreasing geometric progression.
Therefore, trimming the leading 0s is a very modest optimization on the size of the data being transmitted or stored.

However, trimming 0s leads to ambiguities when the IDs are used as correlations with other monitoring systems,
such as logging, that treat the IDs as opaque strings and cannot establish the equivalence between padded and
unpadded IDs. It is also incompatible with W3C Trace Context and Zipkin B3 formats, both of which include all
leading 0s, so an application instrumented with OpenTelemetry SDKs may be logging different trace ID strings
than application instrumented with Jaeger SDKs (related issue #1657).

Overall, the change is backward compatible:
  * links with non-padded IDs in the UI will still work
  * data stored in Elasticsearch (where IDs are represented as strings) is still readable

However, some custom integration that rely on exact string matches of trace IDs may be broken.

##### Change default rollover conditions to 2 days ([#1963](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1963), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

Change default rollover conditions from 7 days to 2 days.

Given that by default Jaeger uses daily indices and some organizations do not keep data longer than 7 days
the default of 7 days seems unreasonable - it might result in a too big index and
running curator would immediately remove the old index.

#### New Features

### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.6.0. The changelog is available here [v1.6.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v160-december-16-2019)

1.15.1 (2019-11-07)

1.15.0 (2019-11-07)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### ⛔ Breaking Changes

* The default value for the Ingester's flag `ingester.deadlockInterval` has been changed to `0` ([#1868](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1868), [@jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling))

  With the new default, the ingester won't `panic` if there are no messages for the last minute. To restore the previous behavior, set the flag's value to `1m`.

* Mark `--collector.grpc.tls.client.ca` flag as deprecated for jaeger-collector. ([#1840](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1840), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))

  The deprecated flag will still work until being removed, it's recommended to use `--collector.grpc.tls.client-ca` instead.

* Fix ordering of indexScanKeys after TraceID parsing ([#1809](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1809), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))
* Small memory optimizations in badger write-path ([#1771](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1771), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))
* Set an empty value when a default env var value is missing ([#1777](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1777), [@jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling))

* Unpin grpc version and use serviceConfig to set the load balancer  ([#1786](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1786), [@guanw](https://github.com/guanw))

#### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.5.0. The changelog is available here [v1.5.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v150-november-4-2019)

1.14.0 (2019-09-02)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### ⛔ Breaking Changes

* Create ES index templates instead of indices ([#1627](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1627), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

  This can break existing Elasticsearch deployments if security policies are applied.
  For instance Jaeger `X-Pack` configuration now requires permission to create index templates - `manage_index_templates`.

##### New Features

* Add Elasticsearch version configuration to rollover script ([#1769](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1769), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Add Elasticsearch version flag ([#1753](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1753), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Add Elasticsearch 7 support ([#1690](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1690), [@gregoryfranklin](https://github.com/gregoryfranklin))

  The index mappings in Elasticsearch 7 are not backwards compatible with the older versions.
  Therefore using Elasticsearch 7 with data created with older version would not work.
  Elasticsearch 6.8 supports 7.x, 6.x, 5.x compatible mappings. The upgrade has to be done
  first to ES 6.8, then apply data migration or wait until old daily indices are removed (this requires
  to start Jaeger with `--es.version=7` to force using ES 7.x mappings for newly created indices).

  Jaeger by default uses Elasticsearch ping endpoint (`/`) to derive the version which is used
  for index mappings selection. The version can be overridden by flag `--es.version`.

* Support for Zipkin Protobuf spans over HTTP ([#1695](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1695), [@jan25](https://github.com/jan25))
* Added support for hot reload of UI config ([#1688](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1688), [@jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling))

* Support index cleaner for rollover indices and add integration tests ([#1689](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1689), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Add client TLS auth to gRPC reporter ([#1591](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1591), [@tcolgate](https://github.com/tcolgate))
* Collector kafka producer protocol version config ([#1658](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1658), [@marqc](https://github.com/marqc))
* Configurable kafka protocol version for msg consuming by jaeger ingester ([#1640](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1640), [@marqc](https://github.com/marqc))
* Use credentials when describing keyspaces in cassandra schema builder ([#1655](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1655), [@MiLk](https://github.com/MiLk))
* Add connect-timeout for Cassandra ([#1647](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1647), [@sagaranand015](https://github.com/sagaranand015))

##### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements

* Change Zipkin CORS origins and headers to comma separated list ([#1556](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1556), [@JonasVerhofste](https://github.com/JonasVerhofste))
* Added null guards to 'Process' when processing an incoming span ([#1723](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1723), [@jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling))
* Export expvar metrics of badger to the metricsFactory ([#1704](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1704), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))

#### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.4.0. The changelog is available here [v1.4.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v130-june-21-2019)

1.13.1 (2019-06-28)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements

* Change default for bearer-token-propagation to false ([#1642](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1642), [@wsoula](https://github.com/wsoula))

#### UI Changes

1.13.0 (2019-06-27)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### ⛔ Breaking Changes

* The traces related metrics on collector now have a new tag `sampler_type` ([#1576](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1576), [@guanw](https://github.com/guanw))

  This might break some existing metrics dashboard (if so, users need to update query to aggregate over this new tag).

  The list of metrics affected: `traces.received`, `traces.rejected`, `traces.saved-by-svc`.

* Remove deprecated index prefix separator `:` from Elastic ([#1620](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1620), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

  In Jaeger 1.9.0 release the Elasticsearch index separator was changed from `:` to `-`. To keep backwards
  compatibility the query service kept querying indices with `:` separator, however the new indices
  were created only with `-`. This release of Jaeger removes the query capability for indices containing `:`,
  therefore it's recommended to keep using older version until indices containing old separator are
  not queried anymore.

##### New Features

* Passthrough OAuth bearer token supplied to Query service through to ES storage ([#1599](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1599), [@rubenvp8510](https://github.com/rubenvp8510))
* Kafka kerberos authentication support for collector/ingester ([#1589](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1589), [@rubenvp8510](https://github.com/rubenvp8510))
* Allow Cassandra schema builder to use credentials ([#1635](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1635), [@PS-EGHornbostel](https://github.com/PS-EGHornbostel))
* Add docs generation command ([#1572](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1572), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

##### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements

* Use json number when unmarshalling data from ES ([#1618](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1618), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Define logs as nested data type ([#1622](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1622), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Fix archive storage not querying old spans older than maxSpanAge ([#1617](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1617), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Query service: fix logging errors on SIGINT ([#1601](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1601), [@jan25](https://github.com/jan25))
* Direct grpc logs to Zap logger ([#1606](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1606), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))

* Add tmp-volume to all-in-one image to fix badger storage ([#1571](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1571), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))
* Do not fail es-cleaner if there are no jaeger indices ([#1569](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1569), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Automatically set `GOMAXPROCS` ([#1560](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1560), [@rubenvp8510](https://github.com/rubenvp8510))
* Add CA certs to all-in-one image ([#1554](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1554), [@chandresh-pancholi](https://github.com/chandresh-pancholi))

#### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.3.0. The changelog is available here [v1.3.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v130-june-21-2019)

1.12.0 (2019-05-16)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### ⛔ Breaking Changes
- The `kafka` flags were removed in favor of `kafka.producer` and `kafka.consumer` flags ([#1424](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1424), [@ledor473](https://github.com/ledor473))

    The following flags have been **removed** in the Collector and the Ingester:
    ```
    --kafka.brokers
    --kafka.encoding
    --kafka.topic
    --ingester.brokers
    --ingester.encoding
    --ingester.topic
    --ingester.group-id
    ```

    In the Collector, they are replaced by:
    ```
    --kafka.producer.brokers
    --kafka.producer.encoding
    --kafka.producer.topic
    ```

    In the Ingester, they are replaced by:
    ```
    --kafka.consumer.brokers
    --kafka.consumer.encoding
    --kafka.consumer.topic
    --kafka.consumer.group-id
    ```

* Add Admin port and group all ports in one file ([#1442](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1442), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))

    This change fixes issues [#1428](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1428), [#1332](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1332) and moves all metrics endpoints from API ports to **admin ports**. It requires re-configuring Prometheus scraping rules. Each Jaeger binary has its own admin port that can be found under `--admin-http-port` command line flag by running the `${binary} help` command.

1.11.0 (2019-03-07)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### ⛔ Breaking Changes
- Introduce `kafka.producer` and `kafka.consumer` flags to replace `kafka` flags ([#1360](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1360), [@ledor473](https://github.com/ledor473))

    The following flags have been deprecated in the Collector and the Ingester:
    ```
    --kafka.brokers
    --kafka.encoding
    --kafka.topic
    ```

    In the Collector, they are replaced by:
    ```

- Use `CQLSH_HOST` in final call to `cqlsh` ([#1372](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1372), [@funny-falcon](https://github.com/funny-falcon))

#### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.1.0. The changelog is available here [v1.1.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v110-march-3-2019)


1.10.1 (2019-02-21)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements

- Separate query-service functionality from http handler ([#1312](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1312), [@annanay25](https://github.com/annanay25))

#### UI Changes


1.10.0 (2019-02-15)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### ⛔ Breaking Changes

- Remove cassandra SASI indices ([#1328](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1328), [@black-adder](https://github.com/black-adder))

Migration Path:

1. Run `plugin/storage/cassandra/schema/migration/v001tov002part1.sh` which will copy dependencies into a csv, update the `dependency UDT`, create a new `dependencies_v2` table, and write dependencies from the csv into the `dependencies_v2` table.
2. Run the collector and query services with the cassandra flag `cassandra.enable-dependencies-v2=true` which will instruct jaeger to write and read to and from the new `dependencies_v2` table.
3. Update [spark job](https://github.com/jaegertracing/spark-dependencies) to write to the new `dependencies_v2` table. The feature will be done in [#58](https://github.com/jaegertracing/spark-dependencies/issues/58).
4. Run `plugin/storage/cassandra/schema/migration/v001tov002part2.sh` which will DELETE the old dependency table and the SASI index.

Users who wish to continue to use the v1 table don't have to do anything as the cassandra flag `cassandra.enable-dependencies-v2` will default to false. Users may migrate on their own timeline however new features will be built solely on the `dependencies_v2` table. In the future, we will remove support for v1 completely.

- Remove `ErrorBusy`, it essentially duplicates `SpansDropped` ([#1091](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1091), [@cstyan](https://github.com/cstyan))

##### New Features

- Support certificates in elasticsearch scripts ([#1339](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1399), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
- Add ES Rollover support to main indices ([#1309](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1309), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

#### UI Changes


1.9.0 (2019-01-21)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### ⛔ Breaking Changes

- Change Elasticsearch index prefix from `:` to `-` ([#1284](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1284), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

Changed index prefix separator from `:`  to `-` because Elasticsearch 7 does not allow `:` in index name.
Jaeger query still reads from old indices containing `-` as a separator, therefore no configuration or migration changes are required.



- Add CLI configurable `es.max-num-spans` while retrieving spans from ES ([#1283](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1283), [@annanay25](https://github.com/annanay25))

The default value is set to 10000. Before no limit was applied.


- Update to jaeger-lib 2 and latest sha for jaeger-client-go, to pick up refactored metric names ([#1282](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1282), [@objectiser](https://github.com/objectiser))

Update to latest version of `jaeger-lib`, which includes a change to the naming of counters exported to
prometheus, to follow the convention of using a `_total` suffix, e.g. `jaeger_query_requests` is now
`jaeger_query_requests_total`.

Jaeger go client metrics, previously under the namespace `jaeger_client_jaeger_` are now under
`jaeger_tracer_`.


- Add gRPC metrics to agent ([#1180](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1180), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

The following metrics:
```
jaeger_agent_tchannel_reporter_batch_size{format="jaeger"} 0

```
have been renamed to:
```

jaeger_agent_collector_proxy{endpoint="sampling",protocol="tchannel",result="err"} 0
jaeger_agent_collector_proxy{endpoint="sampling",protocol="tchannel",result="ok"} 0
```

- Rename tcollector proxy metric in agent ([#1182](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1182), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

The following metric:
```
jaeger_http_server_errors{source="tcollector-proxy",status="5xx"}
```
has been renamed to:
```
jaeger_http_server_errors{source="collector-proxy",status="5xx"}

1.8.0 (2018-11-12)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### ⛔ Breaking Changes

- Refactor agent configuration ([#1092](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1092), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

The following agent flags has been deprecated in order to support multiple reporters:
```bash
--collector.host-port
--discovery.conn-check-timeout
--discovery.min-peers
```
New flags:
```bash
--reporter.tchannel.host-port
--reporter.tchannel.discovery.conn-check-timeout
--reporter.tchannel.discovery.min-peers
```

- Various changes around metrics produced by jaeger-query: Names scoped to the query component, generated for all span readers (not just ES), consolidate query metrics and include result tag ([#1074](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1074), [#1075](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1075) and [#1096](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1096), [@objectiser](https://github.com/objectiser))

For example, sample of metrics produced for `find_traces` operation before:

```
jaeger_find_traces_attempts 1
jaeger_find_traces_errLatency_bucket{le="0.005"} 0
jaeger_find_traces_errors 0
jaeger_find_traces_okLatency_bucket{le="0.005"} 0
jaeger_find_traces_responses_bucket{le="0.005"} 1
jaeger_find_traces_successes 1
```

And now:

```
jaeger_query_latency_bucket{operation="find_traces",result="err",le="0.005"} 0
jaeger_query_latency_bucket{operation="find_traces",result="ok",le="0.005"} 2
jaeger_query_requests{operation="find_traces",result="err"} 0
jaeger_query_requests{operation="find_traces",result="ok"} 2
jaeger_query_responses_bucket{operation="find_traces",le="0.005"} 2
```

  $ docker run -it --rm jaegertracing/jaeger-collector help
  ```

- Detect HTTP payload format from Content-Type (#916) by Yuri Shkuro (@yurishkuro)
