INSERT -  Inserts the key/value to attributes when the key does not exist.
          No action is applied to attributes where the key already exists.
          Either Value, FromAttribute or FromContext must be set.
UPDATE -  Updates an existing key with a value. No action is applied
          to attributes where the key does not exist.
          Either Value, FromAttribute or FromContext must be set.
UPSERT -  Performs insert or update action depending on the attributes
          containing the key. The key/value is inserted to attributes
          that did not originally have the key. The key/value is updated
          for attributes where the key already existed.
          Either Value, FromAttribute or FromContext must be set.
DELETE  - Deletes the attribute. If the key doesn't exist,
          no action is performed.
HASH    - Calculates the SHA-1 hash of an existing value and overwrites the
          value with its SHA-1 hash result. If the feature gate
          `coreinternal.attraction.hash.sha256` is enabled, it uses SHA2-256
          instead.
EXTRACT - Extracts values using a regular expression rule from the input
          'key' to target keys specified in the 'rule'. If a target key
          already exists, it will be overridden.
CONVERT  - converts the type of an existing attribute, if convertable
This is a required field.
  - **`ConvertedType`** *(string, required)*: ConvertedType specifies the target type of an attribute to be converted
If the key doesn't exist, no action is performed.

the value. If the attribute doesn't exist, no action is performed.
  - **`FromContext`** *(string, required)*: FromContext specifies the context value to use to populate
the value. The values would be searched in client.Info.Metadata.
If the key doesn't exist, no action is performed.
If the key has multiple values the values will be joined with `;` separator.
  - **`Key`** *(string, required)*: Key specifies the attribute to act upon.
This is a required field.
  - **`RegexPattern`** *(string, required)*: A regex pattern must be specified for the action EXTRACT.
It uses the attribute specified by `key' to extract values from
The target keys are inferred based on the names of the matcher groups
provided and the names will be inferred based on the values of the
