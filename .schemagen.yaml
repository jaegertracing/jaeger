# Schemagen configuration for Jaeger
# See: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/cmd/schemagen/README.md

# Mappings tell schemagen how to treat specific selector expressions as
# primitive schema fields. Each mapping converts the Go type into a scalar
# schemaType and can also set the JSON Schema format.
mappings:
  time:
    Duration:
      schemaType: string
      format: duration

# Lists repositories that schemagen can make references to when
# generating $ref pointers. If a repo is not listed here, schemagen
# will use type "any".
