# This defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to this node on the ring
# The more tokens, relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data
# that this node will store. You probably want all nodes to have the same number
# of tokens assuming they have equal hardware capability.
#
# If you leave this unspecified, Cassandra will use the default of 1 token for legacy compatibility,
# and will use the initial_token as described below.
#
# Specifying initial_token will override this setting on the node's initial start,
# on subsequent starts, this setting will apply even if initial token is set.

# See https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/production.html#tokens for

num_tokens: 16

# Triggers automatic allocation of num_tokens tokens for this node. The allocation
# algorithm attempts to choose tokens in a way that optimizes replicated load over
# the nodes in the datacenter for the replica factor.
#
# The load assigned to each node will be close to proportional to its number of
# vnodes.
#
# Only supported with the Murmur3Partitioner.

# Replica factor is determined via the replication strategy used by the specified

# repair_session_space:

# The number of simultaneous Merkle tree requests during repairs that can
# be performed by a repair command. The size of each validation request is
# limited by the repair_session_space property, so setting this to 1 will make
# sure that a repair command doesn't exceed that limit, even if the repair
# command is repairing multiple tables or multiple virtual nodes.
#
# There isn't a limit by default for backwards compatibility, but this can
# produce OOM for  commands repairing multiple tables or multiple virtual nodes.
# A limit of just 1 simultaneous Merkle tree request is generally recommended
# with no virtual nodes so repair_session_space, and thereof the Merkle tree
# resolution, can be high. For virtual nodes a value of 1 with the default
# repair_session_space value will produce higher resolution Merkle trees
# at the expense of speed. Alternatively, when working with virtual nodes it
# can make sense to reduce the repair_session_space and increase the value of
# concurrent_merkle_tree_requests because each range will contain fewer data.
#
# For more details see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-19336.

# Total space to use for commit logs on disk.
#
# If space gets above this value, Cassandra will flush every dirty CF
# in the oldest segment and remove it.  So a small total commitlog space
# will tend to cause more flush activity on less-active columnfamilies.
#
# The default value is the smaller of 8192, and 1/4 of the total space
# of the commitlog volume.
#
# commitlog_total_space: 8192MiB

# This sets the number of memtable flush writer threads per disk
# as well as the total number of memtables that can be flushed concurrently.
# These are generally a combination of compute and IO bound.
#
# Memtable flushing is more CPU efficient than memtable ingest and a single thread
# can keep up with the ingest rate of a whole server on a single fast disk
# until it temporarily becomes IO bound under contention typically with compaction.
# At that point you need multiple flush threads. At some point in the future
# it may become CPU bound all the time.
#
# You can tell if flushing is falling behind using the MemtablePool.BlockedOnAllocation
# metric which should be 0, but will be non-zero if threads are blocked waiting on flushing
# to free memory.
#
# memtable_flush_writers defaults to two for a single data directory.
# This means that two  memtables can be flushed concurrently to the single data directory.
# If you have multiple data directories the default is one memtable flushing at a time
# but the flush will use a thread per data directory so you will get two or more writers.
#
# Two is generally enough to flush on a fast disk [array] mounted as a single data directory.
# Adding more flush writers will result in smaller more frequent flushes that introduce more
# compaction overhead.
#
# There is a direct tradeoff between number of memtables that can be flushed concurrently
# and flush size and frequency. More is not better you just need enough flush writers
# to never stall waiting for flushing to free memory.

# endpoint_snitch -- Set this to a class that implements

#
# - it teaches Cassandra enough about your network topology to route

# - it allows Cassandra to spread replicas around your cluster to avoid
#   correlated failures. It does this by grouping machines into
#   "datacenters" and "racks."  Cassandra will do its best not to have
#   more than one replica on the same "rack" (which may not actually
#   be a physical location)
#
# CASSANDRA WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SWITCH TO AN INCOMPATIBLE SNITCH
# ONCE DATA IS INSERTED INTO THE CLUSTER.  This would cause data loss.
# This means that if you start with the default SimpleSnitch, which
# locates every node on "rack1" in "datacenter1", your only options
# if you need to add another datacenter are GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
# (and the older PFS).  From there, if you want to migrate to an
# incompatible snitch like Ec2Snitch you can do it by adding new nodes
# under Ec2Snitch (which will locate them in a new "datacenter") and
# decommissioning the old ones.
#
# Out of the box, Cassandra provides:
#
# SimpleSnitch:

#    locality when disabling read repair.  Only appropriate for

# GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
#    This should be your go-to snitch for production use.  The rack
#    and datacenter for the local node are defined in
#    cassandra-rackdc.properties and propagated to other nodes via
#    gossip.  If cassandra-topology.properties exists, it is used as a
#    fallback, allowing migration from the PropertyFileSnitch.
#
# PropertyFileSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
#    explicitly configured in cassandra-topology.properties.
#
# Ec2Snitch:
#    Appropriate for EC2 deployments in a single Region. Loads Region
#    and Availability Zone information from the EC2 API. The Region is
#    treated as the datacenter, and the Availability Zone as the rack.
#    Only private IPs are used, so this will not work across multiple
#    Regions.
#
# Ec2MultiRegionSnitch:
#    Uses public IPs as broadcast_address to allow cross-region
#    connectivity.  (Thus, you should set seed addresses to the public
#    IP as well.) You will need to open the storage_port or
#    ssl_storage_port on the public IP firewall.  (For intra-Region
#    traffic, Cassandra will switch to the private IP after
#    establishing a connection.)
#
# RackInferringSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
#    assumed to correspond to the 3rd and 2nd octet of each node's IP
#    address, respectively.  Unless this happens to match your
#    deployment conventions, this is best used as an example of
#    writing a custom Snitch class and is provided in that spirit.
#
# You can use a custom Snitch by setting this to the full class name
# of the snitch, which will be assumed to be on your classpath.

#####################

# When executing a scan, within or across a partition, we need to keep the
# tombstones seen in memory so we can return them to the coordinator, which
# will use them to make sure other replicas also know about the deleted rows.
# With workloads that generate a lot of tombstones, this can cause performance
# problems and even exaust the server heap.
# (http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/cassandra-anti-patterns-queues-and-queue-like-datasets)
# Adjust the thresholds here if you understand the dangers and want to
# scan more tombstones anyway.  These thresholds may also be adjusted at runtime
# using the StorageService mbean.

# Filtering and secondary index queries at read consistency levels above ONE/LOCAL_ONE use a

# Uncomment the startup checks and configure them appropriately to cover your needs.

#    ownership_filename: ".cassandra_fs_ownership" # (overriden by "cassandra.fs_ownership_filename")
# Prevents a node from starting if snitch's data center differs from previous data center.
#  check_dc:
#    enabled: true # (overriden by cassandra.ignore_dc system property)
# Prevents a node from starting if snitch's rack differs from previous rack.
#  check_rack:
#    enabled: true # (overriden by cassandra.ignore_rack system property)
# Enable this property to fail startup if the node is down for longer than gc_grace_seconds, to potentially
# prevent data resurrection on tables with deletes. By default, this will run against all keyspaces and tables
# except the ones specified on excluded_keyspaces and excluded_tables.
