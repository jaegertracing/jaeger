# This config is needed for crossdock testing which requires:
# - jaeger receivers (thrift, grpc) for legacy agent testing
# - zipkin receiver for zipkin compatibility testing  
# - grpc storage backend to jaeger-remote-storage
# No existing config in cmd/jaeger/ provides this combination.
# Based on config.yaml with grpc storage instead of memory.
