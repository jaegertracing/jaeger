# AI Usage Policy

This project allows the use of AI tools (like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) as helpers. But AI is not a replacement for your own understanding and work.

## What's okay

- Using AI to help you understand the code
- Using AI to write drafts of code, tests, or docs
- Using AI to explore ideas or try different approaches
- Saying "AI helped me write this" in your PR description

## What's not okay

- Copy-pasting AI output without reading or understanding it
- Submitting code that doesn't compile or doesn't work
- Submitting PRs without running tests first
- Using AI to reply to review comments – reviewers want to talk to you, not a bot

## Your responsibility

- You own everything you submit, even if AI wrote it
- You must understand your code well enough to explain it
- You must run tests locally before opening or updating a PR
- If AI wrote a big part of your PR, mention that in the PR description

## Maintainer rights

- Maintainers can close PRs that look like low-effort AI spam
- Maintainers can ask questions if your replies sound auto-generated
