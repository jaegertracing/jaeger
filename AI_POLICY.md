# AI Usage Policy for Jaeger

This policy has been created to clarify and explain how and what the project Jaeger permits in terms of Generative AI usage in contribution to this project.

## Why this policy is required

With the recent increase in the use of AI and AI coding tools, there has been an increase in the influx of low-quality, low to no human-intervention, and blind PRs. Such PRs waste the maintainers' time and resources, as well as populate the Pull Requests section, hiding the real quality contributions. Thus, it is important to define rules and regulate the usage of Generative AI in contributions to the project.
