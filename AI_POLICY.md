# AI Usage Policy for Jaeger

This policy has been created to clarify and explain how and what the project Jaeger permits in terms of Generative AI usage in contribution to this project.

## Why this policy is required

With the recent increase in the use of AI and AI coding tools, there has been an increase in the influx of low-quality, low to no human-intervention, and blind PRs. Such PRs waste the maintainers' time and resources, as well as populate the Pull Requests section, hiding the real quality contributions. Thus, it is important to define rules and regulate the usage of Generative AI in contributions to the project.

## Guidelines

### Where AI is allowed

Generative AI may be used in the following cases, provided the contributor fully understands, reviews, and takes responsibility for the output:

**Minor code modifications**  
Small refactors, formattings, repetitive edits and similar cases where the contributor can clearly explain the change and its impact.

**Documentation assistance**  
Improving grammar, clarity, or structure of documentation, READMEs, or comments, as long as the technical meaning, provided by YOU, the contributor, is preserved and verified.

**Idea exploration and alternatives**  
Using AI to explore possible approaches, edge cases, or design trade-offs before implementing a solution manually. Of course, your own thought process is still important here.

### What is NOT allowed

**Blind or unreviewed AI-generated PRs**  
Submissions where the contributor cannot clearly explain what the code does, why it is needed, or how it works.

**"Vibe coding"**  
Generating large amounts of code without understanding, validating, or reasoning about it. There needs to be a major human factor in whatever you contribute.

**Large architectural changes generated by AI**  
Any AI-generated design, refactor, or architectural change affecting any major part of the project.

**Copy-pasted AI output**  
Submitting AI output verbatim without meaningful human intervention, refinement, or validation.

**Security sensitive sections**  
AI-generated code touching authentication, authorization, networking, tracing correctness, performance-critical paths, or data handling is strictly not allowed. AI has been known for underperforming in the terms of security, and letting such changes pass through may lead to a catastrophe.

**PRs created primarily to "try out" AI tools**  
Jaeger is not a playground for testing AI coding tools.

## Core Principles

**Human ownership**  
Every PR needs to have a human author who understands the change fully and can maintain it going forward.

**Explainability**  
Contributors must be able to explain what the change does, why it is needed, and how it works.

**Quality over quantity**  
Fewer, well-considered PRs are always preferred over many low-quality submissions.

**Maintainer time is valuable**  
Contributions should reduce, not increase, the review and maintenance burden. Remember this while while writing the code, the comments, commit titles and description, and PR descriptions.

**Transparency when relevant**  
If a contribution was significantly AI-assisted, contributors are required to mention it in the PR description.

This policy is not here to discourage contributors or gatekeep participation. Instead, it exists to ensure that contributions remain high-quality, maintainable, and respectful of maintainer time. Every single contribution still matters in the open source world. Use of Generative AI does not lower the bar for contribution quality. The same standards apply regardless of how the code was written.

## Note

This policy is in terms with the [Linux Foundation Generative AI Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/generative-ai) and follows it in all regards.
